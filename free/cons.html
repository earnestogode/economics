    <h1 id="title">Let's explore what some of the arguments are against trade protection</h1>
    <div class="name">Misallocation of resources</div>
    <ul>
        <li>Protectionist measures can distort market prices and disrupt the optimal allocation of resources</li>
        <li>By artificially inflating the cost of imports or lowering the cost of domestic goods, protectionism can lead consumers to make purchases that do not reflect true market demand</li>
        <li>This can result in resources being diverted from more efficient uses to less efficient</li>
    </ul>
    <div class="name">Retaliation</div>
    <ul>
        <li>Implementing tariffs can provoke trading partners to retaliate, potentially sparking trade wars that escalate tensions and harm economic relations</li>
        <li>Trade wars can also disrupt global supply chains</li>
    </ul>
    <div class="name">Increased costs</div>
    <ul>
        <li>Tariffs on raw materials can increase production costs for downstream industries, making domestic products more expensive to produce</li>
        <li>This leads to higher prices for consumers and can adversely affect the competitiveness of domestic industries reliant on imported intermediate goods</li>
    </ul>
    <div class="name">Higher prices</div>
    <ul>
        <li>Protectionism leads to higher prices for domestic consumers, as tariffs and quotas can create shortages that drive up prices.</li>
        <li>In some cases, high tariffs have led consumers to seek alternatives in neighbouring countries or contributed to the emergence of black markets for highly sought-after goods</li>
    </ul>
    <div class="name">Less choice</div>
    <ul>
        <li>By limiting imports, protectionism restricts consumer choice, often leaving consumers with fewer options and potentially lower quality goods</li>
        <li>International trade standards and protectionist policies can result in market dominance by a single product variety, reducing biodiversity and choice</li>
    </ul>
    <div class="name">Lack of incentive for domestic firms to become more efficient</div>
    <ul>
        <li>Without the pressure of international competition, domestic firms may lack the motivation to innovate or seek more efficient production methods</li>
        <li>This can lead to stagnation within industries, as firms rely on outdated technologies and processes instead of striving for improvement</li>
    </ul>
    <div class="name">Reduced export competitiveness</div>
    <ul>
        <li>Protectionist policies can make domestic industries less competitive on the global stage by creating a high-cost environment</li>
    </ul>
