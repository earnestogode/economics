    <h1 id="title">Let's explore what some of the arguments are for trade protection</h1>
    
    <div class="name">Protection of infant industries</div>
    <ul>
        <li>Supports young sectors against international giants; Brazil's protection of its new industries as an example.</li>
        <li>Pharmaceutical sector illustrates long R&D phases, high initial costs, and the need for economies of scale to lower unit costs.</li>
        <li>Use of regulatory measures (like additional testing) to shield these industries, fostering domestic growth.</li>
    </ul>
    <div class="name">National security</div>
    <ul>
        <li>Critical sectors like food and defense must be domestically produced for security; EU's agricultural subsidies to ensure food self-sufficiency.</li>
        <li>Domestic production of defense equipment is vital to maintain sovereignty and security.</li>
        <li>Protects the integrity and reliability of a nation's defense capabilities and food supply.</li>
    </ul>
    <div class="name">Maintenance of health and safety</div>
    <ul>
        <li>Import standards safeguard consumers from harmful products; bans on items like the Kinder Surprise in the US</li>
        <li>Ensures imported goods meet domestic health and safety criteria to protect public health.</li>
        <li>Examples include mandatory ingredient listings on food products in the EU to maintain consumer safety</li>
    </ul>
    <div class="name">Environmental standard</div>
    <ul>
        <li>Countries enforce production standards to mitigate environmental harm; UK's ban on microbeads in cosmetics.</li>
        <li>Prevents pollution and protects biodiversity by restricting harmful substances.</li>
        <li>Encourages sustainable practices and the use of environmentally friendly alternatives.</li>
    </ul>
    <div class="name">Anti-dumping</div>
    <ul>
        <li>Addresses predatory pricing and dumping practices where goods are sold below cost to capture market share.</li>
        <li>Protective tariffs and measures counter unfair competitive advantages gained through dumping.</li>
        <li>Ensures fair competition and market stability by penalizing below-cost sales.</li>
    </ul>
    <div class="name">Unfair competition</div>
    <ul>
        <li>Protects against intellectual property theft and ensures fair play in international trade.</li>
        <li>Tariffs and restrictions help safeguard domestic innovators from global infringement.</li>
        <li>Aims to maintain a level playing field for domestic firms against reverse-engineered products.</li>
    </ul>
    <div class="name">Balance-of-payments correction</div>
    <ul>
        <li>Reduces imports to manage trade deficits and stabilize the national economy.</li>
        <li>Aims to improve the country's financial position by adjusting trade policies.</li>
        <li>Supports domestic industry growth, reducing dependency on foreign goods</li>
    </ul>
    <div class="name">Sources of government revenue</div>
    <ul>
        <li>Tariffs as a vital revenue source for countries with limited taxation systems</li>
        <li>Provides financial resources necessary for public services and infrastructure development.</li>
        <li>Often crucial for economically least developed countries to fund government operations.</li>
    </ul>
    <div class="name">Protection of jobs</div>
    <ul>
        <li>Trade protection safeguards jobs in industries vulnerable to international competition.</li>
        <li>Examples include high tariffs on textiles in the USA to protect domestic employment.</li>
        <li>Balances consumer costs against the economic benefit of maintaining employment within critical sectors.</li>
    </ul>
    <div class="name">Economically least developed country diversification</div>
    <ul>
        <li>Temporary protection helps ELDCs develop a broad industrial base for future growth.</li>
        <li>Encourages self-sufficiency and reduces reliance on imports by nurturing key sectors.</li>
        <li>Aims for a diversified economy capable of producing a wide range of goods and services for both domestic use and export.</li>
    </ul>
